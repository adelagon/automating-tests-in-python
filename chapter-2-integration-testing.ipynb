    "## Integration Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common ways for conducting integration tests is conducting API tests. This notebook talk about how to use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) along with [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) to automated tests on a RESTFul API.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will be using the [json-server](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and run it locally for tests (as the public one ignore the POSTS and PUTS). To install do ```npm install -g json-server``` and run it in the background with ```json-server --watch db.json```. This should startup a RESTFul server in ```http://localhost:3000``` that will be run tests on. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Some notes on json-server\n",
    "[json-server](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) uses [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) which is a file-based json database. If you run ```json-server --watch db.json``` and check the contents of ```db.json``` as you test, you should see the database contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "[json-server](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) is not just a fake RESTFul API server that you play around with. It can also be used to create custom mock RESTFul API's as well and it also plays along with [Faker.js](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) to generate the mock data for its database. If you want to know more about how to to this visit: https://github.com/adelagon/javascript-nodejs-gitbook/blob/master/qe/mock.md\n",

    "Some engineering teams have embraced [Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) which encourages collaboration between non-technical personnel (business, product, and traditional QA's) and engineering team that is facilitated by writing together an human-readable document or in other terms a simple Domain-Specific Language (DSL). This document is then used to write software and tests. Often, these documents also serves as user stories.\n",
