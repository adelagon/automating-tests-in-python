    "## UI Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most expensive automated test investments you have to do are UI Tests. For this notebook, we will be talking about how to automate Web UI tests using [Splinter](https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Splinter & pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "[Splinter](https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an abstraction layer for [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) that allows you to automate UI tests. All you have to do is select the webdriver (Browser) that you want, navigate, and interact with HTML DOM elements. Besides testing, Splinter can be used for scraping websites and write bots along with [Faker](https://pypi.org/project/Faker/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly there is also a [pytest-splinter plugin](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-splinter) that makes it work along with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will use pytest and splinter to visit amazon.com and check for availability of **Kindle Paperwhite**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to running the example, you need to install a Driver. This example uses the [Chrome WebDriver](https://splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/drivers/chrome.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like the previous examples, it is important to execute the cell below to enable pytest execution within jupyter:"

    "### Tip\n",
    "\n",
    "Splinter can query DOM objects in many ways. One of the useful ways to locate elements is by using [xpath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath). For complex websites such as amazon.com, running through the whole html source is pretty hard. Luckily, if you use Firefox, you can use the Web Developer Tools to copy the XPath when inspecting an element.\n",
